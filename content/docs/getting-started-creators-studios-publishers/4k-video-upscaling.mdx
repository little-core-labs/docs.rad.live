# 4K Video Upscaling

Creators who have a [Creator+](https://rad.live/payment/?plan=f3145a1a-312f-47c7-8d32-51a3abf527d9\&redirect=%2Fcreator%2Fsetup) subscription can now upscale their content to 4K.

_Note: This is not available for the Private Uploads feature currently. It is only available to creator content that is governed by the Terms of Service for publicly available content on Rad TV._

Here is an example of an upscale going from 480p to 2160p. The image on the left is 2160p upscaled by Rad TV, and the image on the right is the 480p original. You'll notice the Rad TV upscaled version is sharper and a much cleaner image even with the massive increase in pixels.

**Upscaling on Rad TV is a straightforward process:**

1. Make sure you are a [Creator+](https://rad.live/payment/?plan=f3145a1a-312f-47c7-8d32-51a3abf527d9) Subscriber.
2. Upload a video in the Creator Studio.
3. Select the checkbox to Enhance the content.
4. Click Upload.

The Upscaling process can take a long time for long duration files, sometimes many hours, so be prepared to wait for it to finish.

**Additional considerations for 4K upscaling:**

* Any resolution below 4K is acceptable on the input.
* The output height and width will be capped at 4K, whichever limit is hit first.
* The aspect ratio will be honored on the final output.
* Any input video format should work.
* Landscape, Square, Portrait, 360 and 180 degrees, 2D, and 3D video is supported.

Note: 3D video upscaling has the potential to limit the resolution per eye, and the upscaling process does not create 4K per eye. It will only upscale 3D videos that are already in the over-under or side-by-side format.
