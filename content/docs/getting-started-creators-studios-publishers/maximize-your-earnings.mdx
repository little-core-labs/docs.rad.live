# Maximize Your Earnings

The Rad TV team is working hard to get your content in front of as many potential buyers as possible.&#x20;

For starters, all of your followers on Rad TV are notified every time you make a video public. This email provides a direct link to your new content so potential customers are just 1 click away from the buy button or viewing your most recent upload.&#x20;

On top of that we are featuring creator content across our entire platform including all of our apps. Whether your content is made available for free or for sale we are doing our best to generate clicks and get as many eyes on your content as possible. To give your content the best chance of generating clicks here are some things to consider:

**How does your channel make you feel?**&#x20;

* Are you satisfied with the presentation of your individual pieces of content and your channel to potential buyers?
* Do you have a professional channel banner?&#x20;
* Do you have cover images on your videos?
* Does your content have a title that accurately describes your content to generate the click you are looking for?
  * Does your content have rich descriptions and is it clear what buyers are purchasing?

If you need to spice it up a bit, head to your [Creator Dashboard](https://rad.live/channel/) and click the Edit Channel button in the left navigation.&#x20;

**Do you have trailers or clips that promote and provide previews of the content you are selling?**

Trailers go a long way when promoting content. Consider creating clips or a trailer to share on socials that gets potential customers excited and drives clicks to your content.&#x20;

**Do you have any free content available for potential buyers to check out before committing to a purchase?**

The freemium model works. Getting viewers in the door and showing them your awesome content is a great step towards enticing them to make a purchase. Try uploading a few pieces of content and making them available for free.&#x20;

**Have you promoted your content for sale on social media?**&#x20;

Whether it’s through posts on 𝕏, reels, stories or through an email newsletter - reaching out to your fan base, friends, and family directly is the best way to spread the word about your creations and generate sales.

Try sharing the story behind the creation. What does this piece mean to you? Why did you create it? What do you want viewers to feel?

'_Everything_ that needs to be _said has already_ been _said_. But since no one was listening, _everything_ must be _said_ again.' - Andre Gide

**PROMOTE! PROMOTE! PROMOTE!**

As creators we understand the feeling of endless promotion and how it can seem like you are just spinning your wheels. EVERY CREATOR EXPERIENCES THIS FEELING! The important thing to remember is that it won't last forever. You are creating works you love and if you don't share them with the world - how will the world learn that they exist? The thing to focus on is one connection at a time, one conversation at a time, one creation at a time, one sale at a time - keep going! You are one comment, one share, one conversation, one creation away from your next sale or a million sales.&#x20;

**Create a sense of urgency.**

Rad TV allows you to sell limited editions and time based editions. Try out some limited editions and see if you can entice buyers to collect your works before it’s too late!

**Collaborate with other creators or even marketers**

Consider collaborating with another creator on a piece or collections for cross-promotion and a collective tag team on sales!

Rad TV is the only platform that allows you to pay out your entire team at the time of every sale. You can collaborate with other creators and set a payout percentage for each person/wallet.&#x20;

With the Rad TV creator toolset there are creative things you can do around marketing like bringing a marketing specialist on board and ensuring they get a certain percentage of each sale. This gives them an opportunity to earn as much as they can generate without you having to commit to any dollar amount up front. It’s a win for you and a gig for them. Only possible on Rad TV!&#x20;

This toolset lets you focus on creating while trusted partners handle promotion, ensuring your art reaches the right audience and drives sales effectively.

**Buy One Get One**

You already know this works!&#x20;

Try enticing buyers with a free piece if they purchase another piece of yours. Since sales on Rad TV are done through smart contracts on the blockchain, you have every buyer's address and can engage with them forever through their wallet. You could entice buyers to purchase your piece for sale by sending another piece to their wallet after they buy the piece you are promoting. This could be anything. Don’t overthink it. Have fun!

**Have you mentioned how low the fees are and how you (and your team) are paid out instantly and transparently on chain?**

Your fans want you to be successful. Let them know that you are paid out instantly and transparently as soon as they make a purchase. Tell them you are earning 33% more of every dollar through Rad TV than you would through YouTube. Relaying how easy it is to own your content and put money directly in your wallet which allows you to continue creating and serving them the content they love is a meaningful. Don't be afraid to share your story or your art.&#x20;
