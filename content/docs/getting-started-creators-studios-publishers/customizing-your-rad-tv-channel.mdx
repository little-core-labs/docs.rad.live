# Customizing Your Rad TV Channel

**Branding Your Channel and Publishing Video Content**

A channel is created as soon as you sign up for a free account on Rad TV. Your channel is assigned a random name, that you can [update anytime](https://rad.live/studio/channel/), and you can begin uploading, distributing, and monetizing right away! No approval needed.

To customize your channel head to the [Creator Studio](https://rad.live/studio/) and click the [edit Channel](https://rad.live/studio/channel/) icon as pictured below.
