# VR and Portrait Content FAQ

**Creators can now distribute and monetize VR and Portait videos with Rad TV!**&#x20;

In order for VR and Portrait videos to render correctly creators must assign the appropriate ‘hint’ in the video details. This hint tells us how your content is encoded and ensures that the content is displayed correctly during playback.

Follow these instructions to set the hint for your content:

1. Upload your content ([Learn about uploading content](/docs/customizing-your-rad-tv-channel))
2. Head to the video details page by clicking the pencil icon associated with your video in your [creator dashboard](https://rad.live/channel/).
