Smart contracts are a powerful system enabling more transparency on payments, verifiable ownership and provenance of content and collectibles, and functions like resales and royalties built right in. With Web3 video streaming, Creators have more control over monetization, the flexibility to sell editions, the ability to get paid on resales, and fans take comfort in knowing the artists and creators were paid directly.

Rad TV uses this technology to easily pay creators and attach as many collaborator wallets as they’d like, for instant web3 payments. This means an entire production team can be paid when a sale happens. No more waiting months for payouts. No more Hollywood accounting eating away at your bottom line. Transparent instant payments via smart contracts.&#x20;
