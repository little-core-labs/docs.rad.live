# Embed Video from Rad TV

Rad TV supports video embeds, allowing you to showcase your content anywhere on the web. Whether you're building a landing page, running a newsletter, or sharing a project update, embedding your videos lets you extend your reach beyond the platform.

Rad TV doesn’t serve ads, so your content stays yours. No interruptions, no outside branding, or brand confusion. It’s the perfect solution for creators and brands who want full control over their presentation.

Embeds work just like you’d expect: a simple snippet of code you can drop into any site that supports HTML. It's perfect for creators, brands, and developers looking to keep viewers engaged across multiple platforms.

Check out this [how-to video](https://rad.live/watch/feature/ff02e32a-80c5-4dfb-a9d0-57f42d256163).

After you have uploaded content to your Rad TV channel you can easily access the embed code by navigating to your Creator Studio > Clicking My Videos > from here you can see the embed code for each video you have uploaded. A simple click will copy the embed code to your clipboard.

You can also head to the contents playback page on Rad TV and click the share icon > choose embed > copy the code in 1 click > paste and you are done!&#x20;
