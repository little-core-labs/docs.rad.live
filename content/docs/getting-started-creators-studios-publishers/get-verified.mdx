# Get Verified

Being a Verified Creator on Rad TV comes with unique privileges, including enhanced visibility and discoverability across the ecosystem, as well as access to additional monetization options.&#x20;

Verified Creators are identified with our signature purple and black verification badge.

Rad TV’s creator verification process is designed to maintain a high-quality, trusted environment for our community of creators and viewers.&#x20;

**A Creator Channel that meets these requirements is eligible to be considered for verification:**

* Has a channel with a high quality properly sized banner and a profile picture
  * That channel has at least 1 piece of high quality video content set to public
    * That public content must have title, description, and high quality cover image
* Share a link to your Rad TV channel on social media
  * Be sure to tag [@RadNFTV](https://x.com/radnftv) in the post or
  * DM us the link on [𝕏](https://x.com/radnftv)&#x20;

Verification is not guaranteed and may be revoked at any time, without prior notice, if creators fail to adhere to Rad TV’s [Terms of Service](https://business.rad.live/terms), or if actions are taken that compromise the integrity of our platform. In such cases, creators may lose the ability to distribute and monetize their content, have their accounts permanently banned from the platform, and, if warranted, be subject to legal action.&#x20;

Our goal is to ensure that Rad TV remains a safe, fair, and innovative space for creators and audiences alike. By participating on Rad TV, creators agree to uphold these values. We appreciate your commitment to keeping our ecosystem RAD!
