# AI Multilingual Subtitle Generation

Creators who are [Creator+](https://rad.live/payment/?plan=f3145a1a-312f-47c7-8d32-51a3abf527d9) subscribers can now insert subtitles into their videos, with support for \~100 languages.

**Generating multilingual subtitles on Rad TV is a straightforward process:**

1. Make sure you are a [Creator+](https://rad.live/payment/?plan=f3145a1a-312f-47c7-8d32-51a3abf527d9) Subscriber.
2. Upload a video in the Creator Studio.
3. Select the checkbox to Enhance the video.
4. Click Upload.

The AI Subtitle Generation process is part of the pre-processing of the video, so the resulting subtitles are included in the HLS streams and the downloadable .mp4 version.

**Additional considerations for Subtitle Generation:**

* \~100 languages are supported, including some of the most widely spoken like English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Dutch, Italian, and Portuguese.&#x20;
* You can currently only have one language in the subtitle track. You can't have 3 different subtitle tracks in English, Spanish, and Japanese for example.
* Subtitles can be generated from the same language that's in the audio. For example, if the audio is in Italian, the subtitles can be generated in Italian (or English, see below).
* Subtitles can be translated from any language audio to English. Subtitles cannot be translated to any other language except English at the moment. For example, if you have language in the audio that is German, you cannot create subtitles that are in Italian. You can only translate to English.
* Subtitles will potentially be imperfect. We're working on improving this, so please report any issues you see to us.

_Bonus: The subtitle generation process creates a .srt and .vtt file that can also be downloaded._
