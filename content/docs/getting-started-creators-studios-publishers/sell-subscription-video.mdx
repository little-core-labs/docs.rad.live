# Sell Subscription Video

[Approved Creators](/docs/get-approved-for-subscription-payments) have the option to monetize content through Rad TV's Premium Subscription.[ ](/docs/become-an-approved-creator-legacy)

* The Premium Subscription pays creators on a percentage basis of the minutes watched of their content.
* Only Rad TV Premium Subscribers are able to view content included in the Premium Subscription.&#x20;

For example, Rad TV splits the monthly subscription revenue 70/30 with creators. 70% for the creators and 30% for Rad TV. That 70% is then split among all Approved Creators included in the subscription based on minutes watched. If you're a creator whose content is watched 20% of the total minutes for the month, you will receive 20% of the 70% set aside each month for creators.&#x20;

Of course, Approved Creators can also [sell individual pieces of content](/docs/sell-individual-videos) at a 70/30 split (with the potential for more generous splits coming in 2025). This allows for capturing two types of customers. Some people might want to buy a piece of content as a one-time purchase, or they might just want to subscribe to a large library of content.
