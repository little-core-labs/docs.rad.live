# Become an Approved Creator (Legacy)

There are two types of **Creators** on Rad TV.&#x20;

* **Approved Creators**
* **Private Creators**

**Approved Creators** gain a couple of major benefits.

* If an Approved Creator wants to [sell-individual-videos.md](sell-individual-videos.md "mention"), their content will be made available across all devices Rad TV is on, including PlayStation, Android, Amazon Fire, Apple, Meta Quest, and the Web.
* Approved Creators can have their content included into Rad TV's **Premium Subscription** for even greater reach and revenue opportunity to an existing subscriber base, joining a large number of publishers already distributing content through Rad TV's Premium Subscription.&#x20;
* Prioritized Feature Placement Across Apps
* Rad TV Sponsorship Consideration\
  \
  &#xNAN;_&#x4E;ote: Inclusion in Rad TV's Premium Subscription requires providing Rad with your business and/or banking details in order to process fiat, non-cryptocurrency, payouts._ [sell-subscription-video.md](sell-subscription-video.md "mention")

**Requirements** to become an approved creator on Rad T&#x56;**:**

* Monetize 5 videos through cryptocurrency on Rad TV
* Generate at least 10 content sales through cryptocurrency&#x20;
* Creator Channel must have a properly sized and branded banner image
* Creator Channel must have a high resolution Profile Image
* All videos on your creator channel must feature correctly sized and properly titled cover images

Once the requirements above have been met you are eligible to apply.

* Email [content@rad.live](mailto:content@rad.live) to request approval, and send your account name on Rad TV, examples of your work, and a bit about yourself and your company. \
  \
  &#xNAN;_&#x4E;ote: Soon you will be able to do this on the website by adding the appropriate information._

**Private Creators** can still upload and sell **Individual Videos**, but this content will be hidden from the app discovery across devices and will not be included in the Rad TV Premium Subscription. We don't want to stifle creativity, but want to ensure a good user experience first and foremost.&#x20;

**Private Creators** will still be able to access their content in their account.

The reasons for this limitation are obvious, particularly given the incorporation of Web 3 based technologies:

* Random individuals might upload and sell a piece of content that might not fit well with the rest of the content curated on Rad TV. It could be unsavory or a violation of Rad TV's terms of service but not be flagged yet.
* This type of content could also violate the device terms of service where Rad TV's apps live. Devices like PlayStation, Android, or iOS. This would include substantially NSFW content, or worse.
* Someone might upload copyrighted content that needs to be addressed.

**A note on the types of Creators Launching an Externally Hosted RSS Channel on Rad TV**

Either Type of Creator, Approved or Private, can decide to make an external RSS feed and tell their current fans to add that RSS feed to their Rad TV account. In fact, you don't even need to create a Creator Account on Rad TV at all to create and distribute an RSS feed to Rad TV's apps.&#x20;

This means that an external host or channel creator, like a digital magazine, vlog, or other video site that supports RSS feeds, can distribute content to Rad TV users privately and directly to that user's Rad TV account only (it won't show up anywhere on Rad TV's apps, the Rad TV website, or outside of that user's Rad TV account). This RSS feed is totally private between the RSS publisher and Rad TV user, but requires a Rad TV Premium Subscription for a Rad TV user to add an external RSS feed to their account.

Becoming an approved creator is a simple process, and will soon be fully automated on the website during account creation or updating.

For now, to become and approved creator, you must meet the requirements listed above and then email [content@rad.live](mailto:content@rad.live) to request approval. In the email send your account name on Rad TV, examples of your work, and a bit about yourself and your company.
