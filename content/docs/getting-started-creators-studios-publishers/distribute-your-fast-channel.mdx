The Creator Channel you are creating now will serve as your top level branding across the Rad TV ecosystem. This branded channel will be home to all of the content and Live TV Channels you distribute through Rad TV. Of course you can create many channels, but each login can only host 1 channel. Often times, creators have several brands that they work under. Feel free to create as many channels as you need.

Once you are finished with the Channel creation process you will be able to access the Live TV section within your [Creator Studio](https://rad.live/channel/).

After processing is complete, you’ll be redirected to the Live TV section in your Creator Studio, where your new channel will appear with a status of 'Public' or ‘Pending’ depending on if you made your channel public or protected.&#x20;

At any time you can click on the channel and update metadata or change its status.

If your channel is live you can find it in the [Live TV section](https://rad.live/?tab=live-tv) on the main discovery page or in all Rad TV apps that support Live TV.

And that’s it — your FAST Channel is now distributed to over 6 billion devices worldwide. Yes, _billion_ with a B!&#x20;

_\*Note: It is important not confuse your Creator Channel with your Live TV channels. A Creator Channel which you will need to create in order to access the Live TV functionality._
