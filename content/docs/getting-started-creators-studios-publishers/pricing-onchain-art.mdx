# Pricing Onchain Art

Pricing art for onchain marketplaces requires a delicate balance. As a creator, you want to ensure your pieces are accessible enough to sell while reflecting their true value and your efforts. Here’s a guide to help you set the right price for your digital creations:

**Understand the Market Landscape**

* Research similar art on Rad TV. Look at pricing trends for pieces with comparable quality, style, and format.
* Take note of what’s selling quickly versus what lingers. This gives you an idea of pricing ranges that resonate with buyers.

**Assess the Value of Your Art**

* **Time and Skill:** Factor in the hours and effort you’ve invested, along with the complexity of your work.
* **Rarity:** Is this a one-of-a-kind piece or part of a limited collection? Exclusivity can command higher prices. Consider Open, Limited, or Timed Editions and the impact rarity could have on your marketability.
* **Your Brand:** Established artists with a following can charge more than new creators. Build your reputation to elevate your perceived value over time.

**Pricing for Editions**

* **1 of 1 Artworks:** These are your most exclusive creations. Price them higher to reflect their unique nature. Collectors seeking originality and exclusivity often perceive 1 of 1 pieces to have a higher value.
* **Limited Editions:** With a set number of pieces available, you can balance accessibility and exclusivity. Price limited editions lower than 1 of 1s but high enough to reflect their scarcity.
* **Timed Editions:** These are open to anyone who buys within a set time frame. Pricing should be accessible but not so low that it dilutes the perceived value. Consider aligning the price with your audience size and anticipated demand to create a sense of urgency.
* **Tip:** If you are creating a limited edition piece, consider what you would charge for that same piece if you were making it available as a 1-of-1. Divide that price by the number of editions you plan to make available. eg: If you would charge $100 for the 1-of-1 and you intend make 10 editions available—you can charge $10 per edition and create the same $100 earning potential.&#x20;

**Factor in ETH Price Volatility**

* The price of ETH can fluctuate significantly. A price that feels fair today could be undervalued or overpriced tomorrow due to market shifts.
* Communicate with buyers about how ETH fluctuations impact pricing to build trust and transparency.

**Choose a Strategic Starting Price**

* **Move the Art:** For new artists, starting slightly lower than your ideal price can generate early momentum and collector interest. Once you establish demand, you can gradually increase your prices.
* **True Value:** Avoid undervaluing your work. Price at a level that respects your artistry while remaining within a range buyers find reasonable.
* **Showcase Your Art:** Making some of your work available for free is a great way to showcase your creations and give potential buyers a taste of what you offer.

**Experiment and Adapt**

* If your art isn’t selling, don’t hesitate to tweak your prices or marketing strategies. Experimentation is key to finding the sweet spot.
* Engage with collectors for feedback—understanding buyer preferences can help you align your pricing with market expectations.

Setting the right price for your onchain art is about finding the balance between accessibility and honoring the value of your work. Whether it’s a 1 of 1 masterpiece, a limited edition, or a timed release, your pricing should reflect the effort, rarity, and artistry behind each piece while staying mindful of market trends and the volatility of ETH. Remember, your art has intrinsic worth, and the right collectors will see it. Trust your instincts, adapt as needed, and price in a way that invites others to celebrate and invest in your creative vision.
