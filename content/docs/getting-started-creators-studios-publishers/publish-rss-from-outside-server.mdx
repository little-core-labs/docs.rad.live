# Publish RSS From Outside Server

Publishers, Content Owners, Studios, and Creators can easily create On Demand TV channels, Live TV, Movie Channels, FAST syndication, OTT channels, and any type of video or streaming channel in no time using Rad TV's RSS / MRSS feed support. No need to build and maintain your own apps on PlayStation, Android TV, Apple TV, iOS, Apple Vision Pro, Android Mobile, Android TV, Amazon Fire, or Meta Quest. You can even run your own ads through these channels.

Simply generate the XML with your web servers, have the XML elements point to your hosted videos and metadata, and give your users the link to add to their Rad TV Premium account. Create a channel using video hosted remotely on your own servers by creating an RSS feed using [Rad TV's specs below](/docs/publish-rss-from-outside-server#rssfeeds-en-elements).&#x20;

Rad TV's RSS integration allows publishers to launch a streaming channel on Smart TVs, Mobile, PlayStation and VR in a matter of minutes. You only need video hosting and metadata for their video content and it can be made available instantly to Rad TV's apps without the publisher needing to build and maintain apps across devices, saving millions of dollars in overhead.&#x20;

Publishers using Rad TV's RSS integration can deliver nearly any kind of content or subject matter, and your users can simply add that feed to their account for viewing on Rad's apps.

Rad TV has extended RSS 2.0 with a Littlstar namespace, as documented below. While we attempt to support other namespaces, please use the Littlstar namespace for maximum compatibility.

If you are a content provider and wish to support the Littlstar namespace, follow the guidelines below. If you wish to add additional support for premium feeds that require authentication, please contact [content@rad.live](mailto:content@rad.live)
