# Sideloading

## Setup

1. Connect your Quest headset to your computer.
2. Turn on your headset. When prompted "Allow Access to Data: The connected device will be able to access files on this headset", select Allow.
   * On Windows, Quest will automatically appear as a drive on your computer.
   * On Mac, you'll need to install [Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/?fbclid=IwAR3Ay7rndgLxz-bkl_5em_RHVyvLLY6eY2zxUce1_zpqncK-mrtTLEu2SV0) to successfully transfer videos to your headset.
   * On Chromebook/Chrome OS, you'll need to use the Files app to access your headset.
3. Make sure your video files follow the naming convention mentioned below, and drag the files into the default Movies folder. Note: If you need to rename your files, rename them before dragging them into the Movies folder. Quest may run into issues recognizing the new file name if you rename it after dragging it into the Movies folder.
