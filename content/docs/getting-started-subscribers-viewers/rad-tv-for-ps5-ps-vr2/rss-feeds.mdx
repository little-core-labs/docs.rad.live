## How to View RSS Feeds

1. Add RSS feeds to your Rad TV account using the instructions [here](/docs/../adding-external-rss-feeds-to-your-library#viewing-feeds-on-rad-tv).
2. Open the Rad TV app.
3. Make sure you are logged in and have a [Rad TV Premium Subscription](../../premium-subscriptions/).
4.  Go to your Library and open the RSS Feeds section.<br />

5. If the feed you added on your Rad TV account parsed correctly it will show up as a folder (or folder thumbnail).

<Callout type="info">
If the feed is listed on your [RSS Feeds page](https://rad.live/editaccount/?activeTab=rssfeeds) but does not show up in the application, it's likely that the application failed to parse the feed. Please check to make sure the feed follows our standards [here](/docs/../../getting-started-creators-studios-publishers/publish-rss-from-outside-server).
