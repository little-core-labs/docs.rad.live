# Adding External RSS Feeds to Your Library

Rad TV allows users to add external RSS feeds to their profile, which can include content from countless existing external video publishers, magazines, news organizations, and beyond.

Since this content is hosted outside of Rad TV, and users are adding the feeds themselves, the content stays private between the user and the original publisher, and the content is not available across Rad TV broadly for discovery.&#x20;

RSS on Rad TV enables a private viewing environment and a direct relationship with the original publisher, while still leveraging Rad TV's applications for distribution, aggregation, and consumption.

### **How to Add a RSS Feed to Your Rad TV Account**
