## How to upload to your Private Library

Click [here](https://rad.live/watch/feature/808c6871-eb67-4d8a-b272-36269d9b4e70/?source=nft) to watch a short demo.&#x20;

A [Premium+ subscription ](https://rad.live/premium-plus/)is required to access this feature.

Navigate to the 'My Library' section at [RadTV.com](/docs/../rad-tv-community-updates) by clicking on your profile picture in the top right hand corner > then click on My Library.

From the My Library section you can upload new videos, see how much storage space you are utilizing, and see how many upload minutes (transcoding time) you have left for the month.

**It is important that you select the correct hints for your content to ensure that it is transcoded with the right settings.** Rad TV is not responsible for errors in this selection process and upload minutes will not be credited to users that select the wrong option at the time of upload. If you have questions please reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/radtv) or [𝕏](https://x.com/radnftv).

Once you have selected content to upload you will be shown how much storage space the content will utilize as well as how many upload minutes the content will consume. Premium+ subscribers can upload 900 minutes (15 hours) of content each month. Upload minutes do not rollover.&#x20;

After clicking 'Upload Video' users will see that their content begins uploading. Once your video is uploaded you will see that it immediately begins processing. Your files will be accessible as soon as processing is complete.&#x20;

\*Processing times can vary drastically depending on a number of factors.
