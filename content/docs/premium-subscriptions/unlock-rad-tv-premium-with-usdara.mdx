# Unlock Rad TV Premium with $ARA

What you'll need:

●  A smartphone or computer

●  A sheet of paper and a pen

●  About an hour with the room to yourself

## Step 1: Get the MetaMask app <a href="#d452" id="d452"></a>

On your phone, go to [_metamask.io_](https://metamask.io/). From there, click to get MetaMask from your device’s app store. The app is free, and doesn’t require signing up or entering any personal information.

## Step 2: Secure your wallet <a href="#id-9912" id="id-9912"></a>

MetaMask has options to load a wallet you’ve made before. If you’re new to crypto, choose Create a new wallet.

After choosing a password, grab a pen, a piece of paper, and get the room to yourself. MetaMask will lead you through steps to back up your Secret Recovery Phase. This is very important—you’ll use these twelve words to secure/recover your crypto.

They resemble a nuclear launch code from a Bond film. Here's an example:

## Step 3: Get your Ethereum wallet address <a href="#e0d6" id="e0d6"></a>

In MetaMask, there's some letters and numbers in a light blue oval:

This is your Ethereum wallet address. Here's an example:

0xbF6857e94af6b3E8BA0534d630DFFBff49f9bd48

Anyone with this wallet address can see the balance of your account, and send tokens and NFTs to you. They cannot withdraw assets. Anyone with your Secret Recovery Phrase (Step 2) has full access to both receive and send assets.

Tap the blue oval to copy your wallet address. Never tell anyone your Secret Recovery Phrase.

## Step 4: Buy ETH with debit, credit, or bank account <a href="#f21d" id="f21d"></a>

Click the buy button in metamask and follow the steps for your region. When you complete your purchase ETH will be transferred to your account.

## Step 5: Convert ETH to Fiat (USD, EUR, etc) and get in your traditional bank account <a href="#f21d" id="f21d"></a>

So now you have ETH in MetaMask—but how do you change that to dollars in a regular bank account? To do that, you'll use a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, like Coinbase. Search your phone's app store for "Coinbase" or start at coinbase.com

Signing up for Coinbase is similar to opening a traditional bank account: they want your government ID, and connecting a bank account can take a few days.

Once set up, though, you can buy ETH with dollars, sell ETH to dollars, and move dollars between your Coinbase balance and your bank account.

## Step 6: Get ARA <a href="#f21d" id="f21d"></a>

Instead of selling ETH to dollars, you can swap ETH to ARA, and back again.

In MetaMask, tap Swap, type "Ara", and you'll find it:

You can also manually add a token by searching for it's contract address.&#x20;

ARA's Contract Address: 0xa92e7c82b11d10716ab534051b271d2f6aef7df5
